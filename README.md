# Mental-health-in-pregnancy-during-COVID-19-EDA

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, performed on [Dataset Name], providing an in-depth examination of data features, relationships, and preliminary insights. The project includes statistical analysis, visualizations, and potential model implementation to support data-driven decisions.

## Project Structure

- **`exploratory-data-analysis-covid-19.ipynb.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete EDA process, including data loading, data cleaning, visualizations, and preliminary statistical analysis.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required packages and libraries to run this project.
- **`README.md`**: Overview of the project and instructions for setting up the environment.

## Project Details

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: 
   - Data was loaded using `pandas` and checked for any missing or inconsistent values.
   - Appropriate transformations were applied to ensure data quality.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution plots, box plots, and descriptive statistics were used to understand individual features.
   - **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**: Relationships between variables were explored using correlation heatmaps, pair plots, and more advanced visualization techniques.
   - **Statistical Testing**: Hypothesis tests, such as Chi-Square tests, were conducted to verify relationships between categorical variables.
   
3. **Visualization**:
   - Created using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` for detailed and interactive data visualizations.
   - Visualizations include scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more to illustrate key findings and patterns.
